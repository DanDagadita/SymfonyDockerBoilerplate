# Symfony Docker Boilerplate

This is a Symfony 6 and Bootstrap boilerplate. It includes a MySQL database and an nginx server.

Recommended software: Docker Desktop, PhpStorm (used for code editing, but also for entering the Docker container)

## 1. Starting the containers
To launch, install Docker Desktop, and using a CLI (PowerShell is recommended, or PhpStorm's Terminal), enter the 
command `docker-compose up -d` in the directory this project exists i.e. 
`C:/Users/YOUR_NAME/Downloads/SymfonyDockerBoilerplate`.

## 2. Accessing the PHP container CLI
From the CLI, in the same directory you entered the `docker-compose up -d` command, 
enter `docker ps` to get the container IDs, which will be random, and look for the ID of the symfonydockerboilerplate-php 
image (i.e. ID 1eb9a5a63542). Then, enter `docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID bash`, i.e. `docker exec -it 1eb9a5a63542 bash`.
The command you now enter will be executed on the container itself, so in Linux.

NOTE: This is if you don't use PhpStorm. If you do, use the Services tab and access the container's terminal from there.

## 3. Installing packages
Enter `composer install` in order to install the PHP dependencies of the project. They will be installed in the vendor 
folder. (Package example: Symfony) Composer will install packages in the `composer.lock` file, and `composer update` 
will update the existing packages in `composer.json` based on their version constraints.

Enter `npm install` in order to install the npm dependencies of the project. They will be installed in the `node_modules` 
folder. (Package example: Bootstrap) npm (node package manager) works a lot like Composer.

In the initial setup, you have to run `npm run build`, and also after modifying the `assets` folder.

## 4. The next steps
Use the MakerBundle to create Controllers, Entities, and other Symfony specific classes. (They are created in 
src/Controller and src/Entity. You can configure and modify them however you see fit).
In order to create a Controller, run in the PHP container the following command: `php bin/console make:controller`.
In order to create an Entity, run in the PHP container the following command: `php bin/console make:entity`.
For more information, run `php bin/console list make` to see all available MakerBundle commands.

See more about controllers here: https://symfony.com/doc/current/controller.html.

After creating a controller, for instance HomeController, go to http://localhost/home.

## 5. Speeding up response times on Windows
On Windows, Symfony projects that use Docker are slow because of the var and vendor folders. The docker-compose file 
excludes these folders from being synced with the container. It is recommended to un-comment these lines after running 
docker-compose for the first time, for improved performance. (lines 11, 12 and 18, 19 in `docker-compose.yml`). Example 
difference in performance for a response: **120ms** with the lines un-commented vs **1750ms** with the lines commented. 
You can also comment out the `command` line in the `php` service in `docker-compose.yml` at line 15, and manually enter 
those commands (except for php-fpm which is not necessary with the line commented out) in the container.

## 6. Creating a database
Create an Entity using the MakerBundle.

Run `php bin/console make:migration`. Then, apply the migration: `php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate`.
